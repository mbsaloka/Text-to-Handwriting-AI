## 🔎 Project Description
This project aims to develop an AI model that generates human-like handwriting from typed text. Based on the LSTM architecture proposed in [Alex Graves' paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850), the model learns to map character-level text input into continuous pen stroke sequences.

## 📄 Dataset
The [IAM Online Handwriting Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-on-line-handwriting-database) contains pen stroke sequences and corresponding transcriptions from over 200 writers, used for handwriting generation and recognition tasks.
